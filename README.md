# Iterate an object
Iterate through an object in Javascript. The rest is up to you..

# Note
You probably already know that an object in javascript is not iterable, but through a method on the ***'Object'*** object called ***'keys'***. 

Using this method, you can create an array of the objects keys and iterate through them and match them up using a forEach loop then do whatever 
needs to be done to the values of the objects properties.
